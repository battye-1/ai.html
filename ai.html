            <p>Audrey Hepburn remains one of the most beloved figures in film history, renowned not only for her remarkable acting but also for her timeless style and humanitarian efforts. Her portrayal of Holly Golightly in *Breakfast at Tiffany’s* immortalized her as a fashion and cultural icon, with her little black dress, pearl necklace, and elegant demeanor symbolizing sophistication and grace. Hepburn’s ability to convey emotion through subtlety and charm continues to influence generations of actors and admirers alike.</p>
            <p>Off-screen, Hepburn dedicated much of her later life to humanitarian work. As a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador, she traveled extensively to advocate for children in need around the world. Her grace extended far beyond the silver screen — she embodied empathy, kindness, and humility in every aspect of her life, making her a true inspiration both as an artist and as a human being.</p>
